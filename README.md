# Wings of Fury

This is a **game** written in **python**. It is very simple game just like *Wings of Fury* and it has the same screen and sound with the game in *WeChat*. 
I learn this from www.fishc.com. I am very greatful for the teacher.
Though the game is no long in the WeChat App. I would to rebuild it as a way to learn python.
