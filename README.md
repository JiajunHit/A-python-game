# Wings of Fury

This is a **game** written in **python**. 
It is very simple game just like *Wings of Fury* which was in *wechat* few years ago
I learn this from www.fishc.com. I am very greatful for the teacher.
Though the game is no long in the WeChat App. I would to rebuild it as a way to learn python.

It is a wonderful thing to be in **GitHub**. I have dreamed a lot to be one of the programmers. ~~Though it's just a start~~ Everything will be better.
